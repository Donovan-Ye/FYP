# ZhengjieYe's Final Year Project

ZhengjieYe's Final Year Project in WIT in 2021.

## Project structure

The project source code is mainly divided into three parts.
+ [FYP](https://github.com/ZhengjieYe/FYP)
+ [FYP_REACT](https://github.com/ZhengjieYe/FYP_REACT)
+ [FYP_API](https://github.com/ZhengjieYe/FYP_API)

#### FYP -- Key part
This project is designed as a mobile application. This part of the project is developed using Flutter and Dart. Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
#### FYP_REACT -- React part
Because the Flutter project can embed the Webview into the page, and the webview can be used to display the Web page, the project uses React. Some pages of the project show React pages. Mainly for search and application service pages, as well as application tracking pages.
#### FYP_API -- Back-end part
This part is the back-end project of the project. It uses a combination of Nodejs, Express and GraphQL. Provide APIs for mobile app(FYP) and React pages(FYP_REACT).

## Setup requirements
**Please note that you need to start FYP_API first, then FYP_REACT, and finally FYP.**
### FYP_API
+ npm install

+ create a enviroment file in the root.

    .env

[api_env]: ./assets/readme/api_env.jpg

> you need to add following variables in this file:
![][api_env]
>+ The first variable is the address of the MongoDB. Please create a MongoDB for yourself.
> + The last four variables are the setting of the AWS S3 bucket. Please create a bucket for yourself, and then get access Key ID and secret access Key(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

+ npm start

### FYP_REACT
+ npm install

+ create a enviroment file in the root.

    .env

[react_env]: ./assets/readme/react_env.jpg

> you need to add following variables in this file:
![][react_env]
>The variable is the address of the API server. Please note that, if you start the API project locally, please replace Localhost with the LAN IP. For example: http://192.168.0.150:4000. Because whether you are using an emulator or a real machine, you cannot access localhost.

+ npm start

### FYP
+ intall Flutter. You can follow the tutorial(https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) from the offical site to install Flutter.

> Here is my Flutter and Dart version

[flutter_version]: ./assets/readme/flutter_version.jpg
> ![][flutter_version]
+ git 

+ create a enviroment file in the root.

    .env

[flutter_env]: ./assets/readme/flutter_env.jpg

> you need to add following variables in this file:
![][flutter_env]
The variable is the address of the API server. Same as FYP_REACT above.


+ Pico voice setting up
Because the project is designed to use a Voice AI to implement the feature of voice recognition. If you want to test the project, please follow the tutorial(https://medium.com/picovoice/offline-speech-recognition-in-flutter-no-siri-no-google-and-no-its-not-speech-to-text-c960180e9239) to create a enterprise account, you will have 30 days trial to use it freely.
